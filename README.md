# GLibISDemo

Works only on macOS at this time.

Demo created for the purposes of https://github.com/rhx/gir2swift/issues/21

Usage:

```
$ git clone <project>
$ cd GLibISDemo
$ swift run > file.out
warning: dependency 'GLib' is not used by any target
[4/4] Build complete!
$
```

Expected output should look like this: 

[file.out](file.out)
